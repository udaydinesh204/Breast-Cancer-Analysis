# Breast Cancer Analysis 
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Breast cancer can happen in both men and women, but it's far more common in women. 
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect and diagnose breast cancer. The dataset used for this project contains information on patients' medical history, and biopsy results.
The machine learning model will be trained on this dataset in order to learn to identify patterns that are associated with breast cancer. Once the model is trained, it will be used to predict the likelihood of a patient developing breast cancer.
I performed a machine learning analysis on a provided breast cancer dataset. The dataset contains information about the characteristics of tumor samples from 683 patients.
